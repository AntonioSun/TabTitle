# Tab Title -- Give browser tab a meaningful title

If you like to use many open Tabs at once, you'll find this app helpful.

### Background

I used to keep 70 to over 100 browser tabs open at any giving moment.
If I'm searching for something, my open tabs may go well beyond 150,
until I've decided that I've exausted all searched and start to reduce
the browser tabs; before that, each open tab is a todo item.
All these is impossible without the automatic hibernation of inactive tabs,
epecially when my machine has only 8G of memory.

The [Tab Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-suspender/fiabciakcmgepblmdkmemdbbkilneeeh)
can minimize browser memory use to consume in 3-5 times less memory.
It'll automatically suspend, park, hibernate inactive tabs to save up to 80%
of memory, stop unnecessary processes, reduces the demand on your computerâ€™s resources,
thus reduce load on your device, battery and heat.

### Do better

That's supper, but can you do any better? Yes, with the help of this app,
because in each browser window, there will be at least one active tab(s)
that will not be suspended. 

By opening a new tab with this app, all other tabs could be suspended.
The memory saved is huge, as any functional web page would be at least
several K or several M bigger than this app.

This app can even be used in off-line mode. It doesn't even need an
active Internet connection to function, if you have ever visit it once.

### How

Just open a new tab with this app, set a title, and you're done.
The minimized browser window will have a nice title to remind you
what the group of tabs the window consists.
